# Cadence-Cassandra-Workflow

### **_Start by making a directory for your cadence workflows_** 

```
mkdir cadence
```
***I assumes you to have***
* *A basic understanding of Docker images and containers.*

* *Docker installed on your local system, if you haven't please see to install it [Docker Installation Instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/).*

*Make sure docker is running locally, if you donâ€™t have it already, please get it from the docker webpage. Get the latest version of the Cadence YAML file that contains the necessary images using the command below.** 

```
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uber/cadence/master/docker/docker-compose.yml && curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uber/cadence/master/docker/prometheus_config.yml
```
### **_Pull and start all the necessary images in the YAML file_**
```
docker-compose up
```
### **_When the containers are running, then pull the latest Cadence CLI image using the command below_**
```
docker run --rm ubercadence/cli:master
```

*For your Cadence workflow, you must always register a domain for your Cadence workflow, run the following command once before running any new samples with a separate domain. Here we have created a domain called hello-domain.**

```
docker run --network=host --rm ubercadence/cli:master --do hello-domain domain register
```

### *_Note: If you are getting a connection refused problems with registering a domain, you can go into the docker container and execute the following command to register workflow domain._**
```
docker exec -it cadence_cadence_1 /bin/bash
```

### **_Register your domain_**
```
cadence --address $(hostname -i):7933 --do hello-domain domain register
```

### **_Navigate to cadence/src/main/java/com/cadence/App.java and start the workflow_**

### **_Open another terminal to confrim that the domain has been created_**
```
docker run --network=host --rm ubercadence/cli:master --do hello-domain domain describe
```
